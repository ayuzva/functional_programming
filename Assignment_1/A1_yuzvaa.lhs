matches :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [a]
matches given []       = []
matches given (first : rest) | (given == first) = given : given `matches` rest
                             | otherwise = given `matches` rest

elem' given [] = False
elem' given (first : rest) | (given == first) = True
                          | otherwise = elem' given rest

assignPos :: Eq a => Integer -> a -> [a] -> [Integer]
assignPos _ given [] = []
assignPos position given (current : rest) | given == current = position : assignPos (position + 1) given rest
                                        | otherwise        = assignPos (position + 1) given rest

pos :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Integer]
pos given [] = [ -1 ]
pos given sequence = assignPos 0 given sequence
\end{code}

Out of the three functions, the first two are best. I believe that because these functions 
are implemented within themselves and do not rely on helper functions. Pos could be implemented 
via zip filter and map, in which case helper would not be required. Alternatively, if pos requirment
was modified to also take current index as argument it would not need helper.

\begin{code}
--------------------Qustion 2--------------------

applyAll :: [a -> b] -> [a] -> [b]
applyAll [] values = []
applyAll functions [] = []
applyAll (function : remainingFunct) values = (function `map` values) ++ (applyAll remainingFunct values)

\end{code}

\begin{code}
--------------------Qustion 3--------------------
--Using explicit recursion
tripleNeg1 :: (Ord a, Num a) => [a] -> [a]
tripleNeg1 [] = []
tripleNeg1 (value : rest) | value >= 0  = value : tripleNeg1 rest
                          | otherwise = 3 * value : tripleNeg1 rest

tripleNeg2Decorator :: (Ord a, Num a) => [a] -> [Either a a]
tripleNeg2Decorator [] = []
tripleNeg2Decorator values = map (\x -> if (x >= 0) then Right(x) else Left(x)) values

--Using Haskell either and map
tripleNeg2 :: (Ord a, Num a) => [a] -> [a]
tripleNeg2 [] = []
tripleNeg2 values = (either (3*) (1*)) `map` tripleNeg2Decorator(values)

\end{code}

\begin{code}
--------------------Qustion 4--------------------
--4 is not clear what to implement in the functions
data OrBoth a b  = Left' a | Right' b | Both a b

consume1 :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> b -> c) -> OrBoth a b -> c
consume1 f _ _ (Left' x) = f x
consume1 _ f _ (Right' x) = f x
consume1 _ _ f (Both x y) = f x y

consume2 :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> (c -> c -> c) -> OrBoth a b -> c
consume2 f _ _ (Left' x) = f x
consume2 _ f _ (Right' x) = f x
consume2 fl fr f (Both x y) = f (fl x) (fr y)

\end{code}

I believe consume1 is better. It has 3 separate functions applied only once.
This scenario occurs more frequently in practice than having to apply both 
functions, as well as the 'Both' case function on top.

Prove:
    ∀p, xs, ys . all p (xs ++ ys) = all p xs ∧ all p ys

Theorem A : (x:xs) ++ ys = x:(xs ++ ys)

For all xs, ys:
    By induction on `xs`:
        Base case: xs = []
            all p ([] ++ ys) = all p [] ∧ all p ys
                <Definition of all, Identity of `and`>

            all p (ys) = all p ys
                <Reflexivity of equality>
            True
        Induction step: xs = k:ks
            all p (k:ks ++ ys) = all p k:ks ∧ all p ys
                <Definition of all>
            all p (k:ks ++ ys) = (p k ∧ (all p ks)) ∧ all p ys
                <Theorem A>
            all p k:(ks ++ ys) = (p k ∧ (all p ks)) ∧ all p ys
                <Definition of all>
            p k ∧ (all p (ks ++ ys)) = (p k ∧ (all p ks)) ∧ all p ys
                <Induction hypothesis>
            p k ∧ (all p ks ∧ all p ys) = (p k ∧ (all p ks)) ∧ all p ys
                <Associativity of ∧,  Reflexivity of equality>

By induction:
